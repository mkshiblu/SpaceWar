# SpaceWar
Space War is a classic space shooter game with fighter plane. Player has to control his ship and destroy enemy ships using guns and missiles.

Space War is the very first project of my entire programming career. It was developed as the final project for Software Development
Lab 1 in the first year second semester in university. TurboC compiler and C language was used.

#### Features
- Keyboard movement control for the plane.
- Simple enemey plane movement.
- Simultaneous enemey plane fire.
- Scoring.
- Menu.
- 3 different enemy planes.

#### How to Run
- Download and install turbo c++ with integrated virtual box. Simple googling will get you the download link.
- Open the SpaceWar.cpp file in turbo c.
- Compile, Run & Play!


Note: I uploaded the code as it is. So the code is messy and not upto the industry standard. Also I had knowledge of only pure C and nothing
else back then.
